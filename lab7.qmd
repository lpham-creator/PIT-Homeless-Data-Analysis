###### Question

::: question

Write code to pivot longer columns 2 through 97 (i.e. all columns except the first state column) in `pit`. Store the names in column called "Measure" and store the values in a column called "Value." Store the resulting data frame in in `pit_pivoted`.

:::

```{r}
# Uncomment below and write code to pivot dataset. Store the results in pit_pivoted
pit_pivoted <- pit |>
  pivot_longer(cols = !State,
               names_to = "Measure",
               values_to = "Value")
```

###### Question

::: question

Write code to separate `Measure` into two columns. One column should be called `Shel_Unshel`, and the second should be called `Demographic`. Note what symbol separates these two pieces of data: space dash space (i.e. " - "). You will need to specify this in the `sep` argument for `separate()`. Store the resulting data frame in in `pit_separate_1`.

:::

```{r}
pit_separate_1 <- pit_pivoted |>
  separate(Measure, into = c("Shel_Unshel", "Demographic"), sep = "- ")
```

###### Question

::: question

Write code to separate `Demographic` into two columns. One column should be called `Demographic`, and the second should be called `Year`. Note what symbol separates these two pieces of data: comma space (i.e. ", "). You will need to specify this in the `sep` argument for `separate()`. Store the resulting data frame in in `pit_separate_2`.

:::


```{r}
pit_separate_2 <- pit_separate_1 |> 
  separate(Demographic, into = c("Demographic", "Year"), sep = ", ")
```

###### Question

::: question

Remove the string "Total " from the `Shel_Unshel` column. To do this you should use the `str_replace()` function. Replace the string "Total" with the empty string (i.e. "") to remove these characters. Store the results in `pit_str_cleaned`.

:::

```{r}
# Uncomment below and complete the code to replace the string "Total " in Shel_Unshel with an empty string. Store the results in pit_str_cleaned

pit_str_cleaned <- pit_separate_2 |> mutate(Shel_Unshel = str_replace(Shel_Unshel, 
                               "Total", 
                               ""))
```

###### Question

::: question

Create two new data frames - one for `pit_by_gender` and one for `pit_by_race`. To do this you want to extract the rows with values in Demographic `%in%` the following vector of values: `c("Female", "Male", "Transgender")`, and store the result in `pit_by_gender`. Then you want to extract the rows with values in Demographic `%in%` the following vector of values: 

```
c("Black or African American", 
  "Asian", 
  "American Indian or Alaska Native", 
  "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander", 
  "White", 
  "Multiple Races")
```

and store the result in `pit_by_race`.

:::

```{r}
# Uncomment below to create two new tables.
pit_by_gender <- pit_str_cleaned |>
  filter(Demographic %in% c("Female", "Male", "Transgender"))

pit_by_race <- pit_str_cleaned |>
  filter(Demographic %in% c("Black or African American", 
  "Asian", 
  "American Indian or Alaska Native", 
  "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander", 
  "White", 
  "Multiple Races"))

```

```{r}
#| document: show

rm(pit, pit_pivoted, pit_separate_1, pit_separate_2, pit_str_cleaned)
```

###### Question

::: question

Create two new tidy data frames - `gender_final` and `race_final`. For each, you should do this in 3 steps:

Step 1: Pivot the columns `estimate_2015:moe_2020` longer, storing the column names in "Measure" and the values in "Values".
Step 2: Separate the values in Measure into two columns: "Measure", "Year". Note that these are separated by an underscore ("_").
Step 3: Pivot the Measure column wider, taking the values from the Values column. 
:::


```{r}
# Fill in the blanks to clean up these data frames. 

# Step 1
gender_pivoted_longer <- gender |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = estimate_2015:moe_2020,
               names_to = "Measure",
               values_to = "Values")

# Step 2
gender_separated <- gender_pivoted_longer |> 
  separate(Measure, into = c("Measure", "Year"), sep = "_")

# Step 3
gender_final <- gender_separated |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Measure", 
                   values_from = "Values", 
                   names_repair = make.names)
# Step 1
race_pivoted_longer <- race |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = estimate_2015:moe_2020,
               names_to = "Measure",
               values_to = "Values")

# Step 2
race_separated <- race_pivoted_longer |> 
  separate(Measure, into = c("Measure", "Year"), sep = "_")

# Step 3
race_final <- race_separated |> pivot_wider(names_from = "Measure", 
                   values_from = "Values", 
                   names_repair = make.names)
```

```{r}
#| document: show
rm(gender, gender_pivoted_longer, gender_separated, race, race_pivoted_longer, race_separated)
```

```{r}
#| document: show
pit_by_gender <- 
  pit_by_gender |>
  mutate(StateName = state.name[match(State, state.abb)])

gender_final <- 
  gender_final |>
  mutate(StateName = state.name[match(NAME, state.name)])

  colnames(gender_final)[3] = "Demographic"
  
pit_by_race <- 
  pit_by_race |>
  mutate(StateName = state.name[match(State, state.abb)])

race_final <- 
  race_final |>
  mutate(StateName = state.name[match(NAME, state.name)])

  colnames(race_final)[3] = "Demographic"
```

###### Question

::: question

Join `pit_by_gender` on the left to `gender_final` on the right and store the results in `pit_gender`. Join `pit_by_race` on the left to `race_final` on the right and store the results in `pit_race`. In both case, you will be joining by three variables: State, Demographic, and Year. We can set the left key variables to the right key variables by setting the `by` argument to this in the join: `c("StateName" = "NAME", "Demographic" = "variable", "Year" = "Year")`

:::
```{r}
head(pit_by_gender)
```
```{r}
head(gender_final)
```
```{r}
rm(gender, gender_pivoted_longer, gender_separated, race, race_pivoted_longer, race_separated)
```

```{r}
rm(pit_gender, pit_race)
```


```{r}
# Uncomment below and write code to join pit_by_gender to gender_final and pit_by_race to race_final. Store the results in pit_gender and pit_race respectively.
pit_gender <- pit_by_gender |>
  full_join(gender_final, pit_by_gender, by = c("StateName" = "StateName", "Year" = "Year", "Demographic" = "Demographic"))

pit_race <- pit_by_race |>
  full_join(race_final, pit_by_race, by = c("StateName" = "StateName", "Year" = "Year", "Demographic" = "Demographic"))

```

###### Question

::: question

Use a data wrangling verb to create a new column in both `pit_gender` and `pit_race` that calculates the rate of homelessness per 10,000 population. Set that column name to `homeless_rate`. Hint: When creating that column, you'll need to divide the homeless count by the population estimate and then multiply by 10000. Store the resulting data frames in 

:::

```{r}
head(pit_gender)
```

```{r}
# Uncomment below and write code to create a new column for homelessness_rate in both pit_gender and pit_race

pit_gender_rates <- pit_gender |>
  mutate(homeless_rate = (Value/estimate)*10000)
pit_race_rates <- pit_race |>
  mutate(homeless_rate = (Value/estimate)*10000)
```

```{r}

             y = homeless_rate,
